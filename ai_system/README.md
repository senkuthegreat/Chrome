# AI System from Scratch

A self-learning AI system capable of understanding, interacting, and streaming to YouTube with automated commentary.

## Features

- **Neural Network Foundation**: Basic learning capabilities with backpropagation
- **Memory System**: Short-term and long-term memory for context retention
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text understanding and response generation
- **YouTube Streaming**: Live streaming with AI-generated commentary
- **Chat Interaction**: Real-time chat engagement during streams
- **Self-Learning**: Continuous improvement from interactions

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install FFmpeg for streaming:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg
```

3. Run the AI system:
```bash
python main_ai.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Chat
- Use 'chat' command to interact with the AI
- The AI learns from each conversation
- Memory is automatically saved

### YouTube Streaming
- Use 'stream' command to start streaming
- Provide your YouTube stream key
- AI will generate commentary and respond to chat
- Requires proper YouTube streaming setup

### Commands
- `chat` - Enter chat mode
- `stream` - Start YouTube streaming
- `stats` - View AI system statistics
- `save` - Save current AI state
- `quit` - Exit and save

## Architecture

- `core/neural_network.py` - Basic neural network implementation
- `memory/memory_system.py` - Memory and learning system
- `nlp/text_processor.py` - Natural language processing
- `streaming/youtube_streamer.py` - YouTube streaming integration
- `main_ai.py` - Main AI system coordinator

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Advanced Neural Networks**: Implement transformer architecture
2. **Better NLP**: Add pre-trained language models
3. **Computer Vision**: Add image/video understanding
4. **Voice Synthesis**: Text-to-speech for commentary
5. **Advanced Memory**: Implement attention mechanisms
6. **Real YouTube API**: Connect to actual YouTube chat API

## Note

This is a foundational implementation. For production use, consider:
- Using established ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Implementing proper error handling
- Adding security measures
- Using cloud services for scaling
